ðŸ“Š This task focused on Machine Learning Model Implementation using the Iris dataset.
I built a classification model using the Random Forest algorithm to:

Train and test the model on flower species prediction ðŸŒ¸

Visualize model performance with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix ðŸ“ˆ

Export the final result in an interactive and presentable format

ðŸ’¡ This hands-on project strengthened my understanding of supervised learning, model evaluation, and practical implementation using Scikit-Learn and Python.
